SUMMARY="Perl Adapter base class module"
DESCRIPTION="The Class::Adapter class is intended as an abstract base class for
creating any sort of class or object that follows the Adapter pattern.  An
Adapter in this Perl sense of the term is when a class is created to achieve by
composition (objects containing other object) something that can't be achieved
by inheritance (sub-classing)."
